`nsesearch` is a powerful command-line utility that indexes all Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) scripts on your local machine, allowing you to find the exact script you need in seconds. No more browsing the web. Search by name, category, description, author, port hints, and more, then immediately view, diff, or generate an `nmap` command to run your findings.

---

## Key Features

-   **‚ö° Blazing Fast & Offline:** Searches a pre-built JSON index for instant results.
-   **üéØ Advanced Search:** Query by name, description, category, author, port, or service. Combine terms with `AND`/`OR` logic and use regex for complex searches.
-   **üé® Rich Output:**
    -   View results in clean, auto-sizing tables.
    -   Export to **JSON, YAML, CSV, TSV, XML,** or **NDJSON** for scripting.
    -   Colorized terminal output highlights your search terms.
-   **üîé Script Inspection:**
    -   Display any script's full source code with **Lua syntax highlighting**.
    -   Show a script's dependencies (`require` statements).
    -   **Diff** two scripts directly from the command line.
-   **üöÄ Nmap Integration:**
    -   Instantly **generate `nmap` commands** with the correct `--script` and `-p` arguments.
    -   Directly **execute `nmap` commands** against a target.
-   **‚öôÔ∏è Simple & Portable:** Single Python script with no external dependencies required.

## Installation

`nsesearch.py` is a single script and requires only Python 3.6+.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/haydena23/nsesearch.git
    cd nsesearch
    ```

2.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x nsesearch.py
    ```

3.  **Create a symbolic link** for easy access from anywhere (recommended):
    ```bash
    sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/nsesearch.py" /usr/local/bin/nsesearch
    ```
    Now you can just run `nsesearch` instead of `./nsesearch.py`.

## First-Time Setup: Build the Index

Before you can search, you need to create the script index. This is a one-time step. `nsesearch` will automatically find scripts in common Nmap installation directories.

```bash
nsesearch --update
```
This command scans your system, parses all `.nse` files, and saves the metadata to `~/.cache/nsesearch/index.json`. Run this command again whenever you update Nmap or add new custom scripts.

## Usage & Examples

### 1. Basic Search

Search terms are combined with `AND`. Use `OR` for alternative terms.

```bash
# Find scripts related to both http and wordpress
nsesearch http wordpress

# Find scripts for either SMB or SQL brute-forcing
nsesearch "smb brute OR sql brute"
```

### 2. Filtering

Narrow your search with powerful filters.

```bash
# Find all vulnerability scripts for the http service
nsesearch -c vuln --service http

# Find scripts by a specific author, excluding any that are "intrusive"
nsesearch -a "Paulino Calderon" -e intrusive

# Find scripts that might run on web servers
nsesearch --port 80,443,8080
```

### 3. Using Regex

For highly specific patterns, use the `--regex` flag.

```bash
# Find scripts with "backdoor" in their name or description (case-insensitive)
nsesearch -r "backdoor"

# Find scripts matching a specific Microsoft vulnerability pattern
nsesearch -r "ms[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{3}"
```

### 4. Viewing Script Content

Found a script? View its source code with syntax highlighting right in your terminal.

```bash
nsesearch --show http-title
```

### 5. Generating & Running Nmap Commands

This is where `nsesearch` truly shines. Find scripts and immediately put them to use.

```bash
# 1. Find all "safe" discovery scripts
# 2. Generate an nmap command to run them against a target
nsesearch -c discovery,safe --run 192.168.1.1

# Output:
# nmap --script afp-serverinfo,banner,... --script-args <...args> 192.168.1.1

# Or, execute the command directly and see the nmap output
nsesearch -c vuln --service http --port 80 --exec scanme.nmap.org
```

### 6. Changing Output Format

Pipe search results into other tools by changing the output format.

```bash
# Get results as JSON
nsesearch http-vuln --format json

# Get just the file paths, one per line (table is the default)
nsesearch --paths-only http-enum
```

**JSON Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "Script": "http-vuln-cve2017-5638",
    "Categories": "exploit,vuln",
    "Description": "Exploits Apache Struts RCE vulnerability CVE-2017-5638.",
    "Path": "/usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-vuln-cve2017-5638.nse"
  }
]
```

### 7. Listing Categories

See all available script categories and how many scripts are in each.

```bash
nsesearch --list-categories
```

<details>
<summary>v1.0.2</summary>

# **v1.0.2**

This update focuses on adding powerful new features for script analysis, improving search capabilities, enhancing output formatting, and increasing overall robustness and user experience.

#### ‚ú® **New Features**

*   **Advanced Search with OR Logic**: The search query now supports `OR` operators, allowing for more complex and flexible searches (e.g., `"http brute OR smb brute"`).
*   **Exclusion Filters**: You can now exclude specific categories and authors from your search results using the new `--exclude-categories` and `--exclude-authors` flags.
*   **Service and Port Filtering**: Added `--service` and `--port` filters to find scripts relevant to specific network services or port numbers.
*   **Dependency Analysis**: The script now parses and indexes script dependencies (`require` statements). You can view these with the new `--deps` flag.
*   **Script Diffing**: A `--diff` command has been added to compare two NSE scripts (by name or path) and view a colorized, unified diff directly in your terminal.
*   **Direct Nmap Execution**: In addition to generating a command with `--run`, you can now execute it directly using the `--exec` flag.
*   **Lua Syntax Highlighting**: The `--show` command now features full Lua syntax highlighting for improved readability.
*   **Configuration File Support**: The script now looks for a configuration file at `~/.config/nsesearchrc.json` to load default script directories and output formats.
*   **Sorting Options**: You can now sort search results by name, last update time, or category using the `--sort-by` flag.

####  Improvements

*   **More Robust Indexing**:
    *   The index now stores a hash of each script's content to detect changes more reliably.
    *   Added a timeout to the file search to prevent hangs on unusually large or problematic directories.
    *   The index will automatically rebuild if the script directories have changed since the last build.
*   **Enhanced Output Formatting**:
    *   Table rendering is now more adaptive to different terminal widths, improving readability on both wide and narrow screens.
    *   Structured formats (JSON, YAML, etc.) now support optional color highlighting when the `--color=always` flag is used.
    *   Improved HTML parsing to preserve content within `<code>` tags as backticks.
*   **Improved User Experience**:
    *   The command-line interface now has mutually exclusive groups for actions like `--update`, `--show`, `--run`, etc., making it clearer and less error-prone.
    *   Running the script with no arguments now displays a helpful usage tip instead of the full help menu.
    *   Added more detailed warnings for invalid port ranges or misuse of command-line arguments.
*   **Code and Dependency Updates**:
    *   The script now uses `shlex.join` for safer command string construction.
    *   Dependencies like `difflib` and `subprocess` have been added to support the new diffing and execution features.
    *   Internal data models have been updated to include script dependencies and content hashes.

#### üêû **Bug Fixes**

*   Corrected an issue where the author parsing logic could fail on complex, nested Lua tables.
*   Improved the accuracy of service and port hint extraction from `shortport.service()` calls.
*   Ensured consistent handling of file paths and encodings, especially on different operating systems.
*   Fixed a command injection vulnerability when `build_nmap_command` constructs a list of arguments, not sanitizing input before passing to `subprocess.run`
